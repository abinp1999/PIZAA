🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis: From Raw Data to Revenue Insights
📌 The Goal
I took a messy dataset of  pizza sales and turned it into a clear story. The mission? Find out exactly what makes this pizza shop tick—and where it's leaving money on the table.

🛠️ What’s Under the Hood?
SQL: My heavy lifter. Used for data cleaning, calculating KPIs (Total Revenue, AOV), and slicing sales by date/category.

Power BI: Where the numbers became visual. Built a dynamic dashboard to track trends in real-time.

Excel: Used for the initial "quick look" at the data structure.

🚀 Top Finds (The "Aha!" Moments)
Weekend Warrior: Friday and Saturday evenings are the "money hours." (Staffing up here is a no-brainer).

The "Big" Winner: Large pizzas aren't just popular—they drive nearly 46% of total sales volume.

Menu Check: Identified the "Bottom 5" pizzas. These are the ones we either need to market better or cut from the menu.

📂 What's in this Repo?
Pizza_Analysis_Queries.sql: All my SQL scripts (clean and commented).

Pizza_Performance_Dashboard.pbix: The raw Power BI file for you to explore.

I'm a Data Analyst Fresher looking to solve more puzzles like this. If you have feedback or just want to talk data, let's chat on LinkedIn!

One quick tip for the "Human Touch":
In your GitHub repo, click the "About" section (on the right side of the screen) and add a fun description like:

"Cracking the code on pizza sales. 🍕 Data-driven insights to help a shop sell smarter, not harder."

Would you like me to clean up your SQL queries now so they look professional and organized when you paste them into your GitHub file?
